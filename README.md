# Oh hi, World. 

I'm Andrew, founder and principal software engineer of [Unbroken Code](http://unbrokencode.tech), a new digital strategy studio based in Miami, FL. I've spent a decade helping arts and culture nonprofits grow their audiences and scale content production to tremendous effect. Now I'm helping artists, organizations, and startups show off their best digital selves. Umbroken Code proudly specializes in web development, campaign management, marketing and SEO, user experience, and "big ideas." I'm also a proud recent graduate in software development of BrainStation in Miami, FL.
