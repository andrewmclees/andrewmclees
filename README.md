# I'm Andrew, founder and principal software engineer of [Unbroken Code](http://unbrokencode.tech), a new digital strategy studio based in Miami, FL specializing in web development, campaign management, marketing and SEO, and user experience.

I've spent a decade helping arts and culture nonprofits understand, grow, and manage their audiences to tremendous effect. Now I'm helping artists, organizations, and startups show off their best digital selves. I've been told I'm "quirky" but who doesn't like to keep things interesting.

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/amclees) or at the rock show.
